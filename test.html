   <p>The bose.com website presents a good since of the design principle proximity 
     by grouping key bits of information together and isolating other elements. Elements, 
     such as the information text and links have also been grouped or isolated by color. 
     Grouping allows individual elements to be seen as one collective body which leads and draws the eye. 
     The isolation of the Bose logo, however, causes it to stand out from the rest of the information to give it significance.
